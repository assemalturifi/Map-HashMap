# Map-HashMap
•	Map, hashMap used
•	In getExit() instead of returning exit map field, I created a new Hashmap and passed out the exit in the constructor,
so the new map is created that has all the mapping  from the exits map
•	The user can go from a starting location to another by inputting any input such as s,e,n,w or Q to quit the game. 
Also the user can enter words such as please go to West, I want to go to east,
or any sentence that includes a directions(quit, east, west, south, north)
